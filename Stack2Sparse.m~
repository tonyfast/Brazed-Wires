%% Braze Wire Data Compaction
% This dataset was shared with by Amanada Levinson at ONR.
% The data is segmented into three phases:
% 
% * Wire
% * Matrix
% * Braze
%
% The data is Three Phases and very sparse.  I am converting this data into
% smaller sparse matrices.


%% File Structure of the Layers 
% Each Layer spacing is 10 microns and each pixel in plane in 5.15 microns

data_dir = 'Braze-Wire-Stack/'
layers = dir(fullfile( data_dir, '*.tif'));
for ii = 1 : numel( layers )
    A = imread( fullfile( data_dir, layers(ii).name ) );
